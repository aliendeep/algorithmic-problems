/*
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, 
Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi 
ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave 
person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively 
(0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], 
[2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number 
of transactions required to settle the debt.

Note:

A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we 
could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
Example 1:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person 
#0 and #2 $5 each.
Example 2:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
