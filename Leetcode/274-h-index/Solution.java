/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if 
h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers 
have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 
papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as 
the h-index.

Hint:

- An easy approach is to sort the array first.
- What are the possible values of h-index?
- A faster approach is to use extra space.
